My PoC on how to get access to portuguese newspapers premium news.

This PoC works as a google chrome extension.

This proofs the lack of control access to premium news that should only be available to subscribed members.

This PoC works on the following portuguese newspaper websites:
- Observador
- Eco

To install a google chrome extension you should go "manage extensions" -> enable "developer mode" -> select "Load Unpacked Extension" -> select the folder "premium-extension".
